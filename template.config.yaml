# This template file should be left untouched 
# The app will in order:
# 1. Read this file (template.config.yaml)
# 2. Overwrite the settings with those in file config.yaml (it it exists).
#    Note: the HUBIBOT_CONFIG_FILE environment variable can be set to specify where the file is located
# 3. Overwrite the settings with environment variables called "HUBIBOT_<SECTION>_<KEY>" (with section and key uppercase), if these exist.
#    For example, set the env var HUBIBOT_MAIN_LOGVERBOSITY to DEBUG to overwrite the log verbosity
# 4. Overwrite the settings with command line parameters of the form "HUBIBOT_<SECTION>_<KEY>=<value>" (with section and key uppercase), if these exist.
